Should User have a field for the group? Because a user will be in different classes with different groups. It should be removed and the group could be gotten from the class ID (when a user clicks on that class’s link leading him to the group page and so on) and the the email (ID) of the user requesting.

instead of “hard-coding” via using first_member, second_member. 
We could just have a list of the users in that class (reference the class) and they would have a field for the group. we would make the user’s email and the class code be the primary keys


Query -
Select group_num from group where user = $email AND class = $class


To-Do:

Re-do the DB:
	>Remove the group from the user table
	>Redo the group table by listing users instead of groups
	>Change the class ID from int to varchar(10)
	>Create a table to list all students enrolled in a class


NOTE: I changed the following

class table:
	> id - from INT(11) to Varchar(10) (Class Code instead of a number)
	> lecturer from INT(11) to VarChar(40) (lecturer email)

group table:
	> removed first, second, and third members. Instead it will list all users in all 		classes and their group for that class (one user can be in multiple 			classes each with their own group)
	>added group_num
	>changed class from INT(11) to varchar(10)

user table:
	> removed group field
